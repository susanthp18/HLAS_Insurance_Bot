  "questions": [
    "What are the implications of the policy's stipulation that a claim can only be made under one of Sections 21, 23, 26, or 44 for the same event, and how does this affect the overall claims process and potential compensation amounts across these sections?",
    "In what scenarios would a policyholder need to choose between Sections 21, 23, 26, or 44 when filing a claim for the same event, and what are the specific benefits and limitations associated with each section that could influence this decision?",
    "How does the restriction of claiming under only one of Sections 21, 23, 26, or 44 for the same event impact the overall coverage provided by the policy, particularly in terms of overlapping benefits and the prioritization of claims?",
    "What are the procedures a policyholder must follow when determining which section to claim under for an event that could potentially fall under multiple sections, and what documentation is required to support the claim in each case?",
    "How does the policy ensure clarity and fairness in the claims process given the limitation of one claim per event under Sections 21, 23, 26, or 44, and what measures are in place to assist policyholders in understanding their options?",
    "What are the potential consequences for a policyholder who inadvertently attempts to file claims under multiple sections for the same event, and how does this affect their eligibility for future claims?",
    "In what ways do the benefits outlined in Sections 21, 23, 26, and 44 differ in terms of coverage limits, types of incidents covered, and any exclusions that may apply, and how should a policyholder evaluate these differences when filing a claim?",
    "How does the policy handle situations where an event could be interpreted to fall under more than one section, and what guidance is provided to policyholders to navigate this complexity during the claims process?",
    "What are the key factors that a policyholder should consider when assessing which section to utilize for a claim related to a specific event, including the nature of the event, the benefits of each section, and any potential impact on future claims?",
    "How does the limitation of claims to one section for the same event align with the overall objectives of the insurance policy, and what are the broader implications for policyholders in terms of risk management and financial protection?"
