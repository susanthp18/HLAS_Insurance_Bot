  "questions": [
    "What are the implications for a policyholder if they have already made a claim under Sections 19, 20, or 21 for the same event, and how does this affect their eligibility for benefits under Section 44, including any potential overlaps in coverage?",
    "In what scenarios would a claim under Section 44 be denied due to failure to check-in according to the travel itinerary, and how does this interact with the requirement for obtaining written confirmation of delays from carriers or handling agents?",
    "How do exclusions related to strikes, riots, or civil commotion impact the overall coverage under Section 44, and what specific conditions must be met for a claim to be valid in the context of these events?",
    "What are the specific operational issues of a carrier that could lead to a denial of benefits under Section 44, and how does this relate to the policyholder's responsibilities in terms of timely check-in and documentation?",
    "How does the insurance policy define 'adverse weather conditions' in relation to existing public knowledge at the time of application, and what are the consequences for claims made under Section 44 if such conditions were known?",
    "What documentation is required from the policyholder to support a claim under Section 44, particularly in cases of delays caused by the carrier, and how does this documentation affect the claim process?",
    "In the event of a late arrival at the airport or port, what exceptions apply under Section 44, and how do these exceptions relate to the broader context of travel disruptions caused by industrial actions?",
    "What steps should a policyholder take if they experience a delay due to a carrier's operational issues, and how does this situation differ from delays caused by external factors such as strikes or adverse weather?",
    "How does the insurance policy handle claims related to civil commotion or riots, particularly in terms of the definitions used and the thresholds that must be met for a claim to be considered valid under Section 44?",
    "What are the potential consequences for a policyholder who fails to obtain the necessary written confirmation regarding delays, and how does this requirement integrate with the overall claims process for benefits under Section 44?"
