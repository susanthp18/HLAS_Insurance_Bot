    "In what circumstances would a claim for loss of one eye or one limb be processed, and how does the 50% benefit limit compare to the full benefit limits for other covered events, especially in cases of multiple injuries?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for major burns in relation to other covered events, and what are the specific criteria that must be met to qualify for the full benefit limit under this scenario?",
    "What steps should be taken if a covered event occurs, such as death or permanent total disablement, and how does the policy ensure that benefits are paid out efficiently to the designated representatives?",
