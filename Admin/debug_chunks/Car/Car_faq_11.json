  "content": "Q: What is the No Claim Discount (NCD) Protector? How does it work?\nA: The NCD protector is an optional benefit and applies only to policyholders of 50% NCD at an additional premium. It will protect your NCD in the event of a first claim during your policy period. If a second claim is made, the normal NCD rules apply and your NCD will be reduced to 20% on your next policy renewal. The protected NCD is not transferable to another insurer. You will need to renew your policy with HL Assurance in order to enjoy this benefit.",
