  "content": "New characteristic electrocardiographic changes; with the development of any of the following: ST elevation or depression, T wave inversion, pathological Q waves or left bundle branch block;\n\nElevation of the cardiac biomarkers, inclusive of CKMB above the generally accepted normal laboratory levels or Cardiac Troponin T or I at 0.5ng/ml and above; Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality. The imaging must be done by Cardiologist specified by Us.\n\nFor the above definition, the following are excluded:\n\n- Angina;\n- Heart attack of indeterminate age; and\n- A rise in cardiac biomarkers or Troponin T or I following an intra-arterial cardiac procedure including, but not limited to, coronary angiography and coronary angioplasty.\n\nExplanatory note: 0.5ng/ml = 0.5ug/L = 500pg/ml\n\n# 3.
