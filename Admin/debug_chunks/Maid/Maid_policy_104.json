  "content": "Section 12 covers Non-Assignment and Discharge, stating that the insurer will not recognize or be affected by any notice of trust, charge, or assignment relating to this Policy. The receipt of the insured, or their legal personal representatives, or of any person(s) to whom any benefit is expressed to be payable shall in all cases effectively discharge the insurer's liability.\n\nSection 13 addresses Other Insurance, indicating that if at the time any claim arises under this Policy there is any other insurance policy effected by or on behalf of the insured covering the same expenses, the insurer shall not be liable to pay or contribute more than its ratable proportion of any claim for such expense.\n\nSection 14 discusses the Premium Before Cover Warranty, stating that the premium due must be paid to the insurer (or the intermediary through whom this Policy or the insurance was arranged).\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Page 11",
