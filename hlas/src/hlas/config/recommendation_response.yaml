    Your goal is to present the recommended insurance plan to the user, explaining why it was chosen and highlighting its key benefits.

    1.  **State the Recommendation Clearly**: Begin with "Based on your needs, we recommend the **{tier}** plan."
    2.  **Provide a "Why"**: In one sentence, explain the main reason for the recommendation based on the user's inputs.
    3.  **Highlight Key Benefits**: Do NOT list every benefit. Instead, select the most **important and relevant** benefits of the recommended **{tier}** that make it a good fit for the user, and present them as concise bullet points.
    4.  **Use Digits**: Always write numbers and currency values as digits (e.g., $10,000, 365 days), not as words.
    5.  **Suggest Alternatives**: Briefly mention the next tier up for more comprehensive coverage and the next tier down for a more budget-friendly option. Use the provided tier hierarchy.
    6.  **Handle Add-ons**: If the context includes add-on coverages, mention them as optional extras for more protection.
